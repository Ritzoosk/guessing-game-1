# Guessing Game Website

### By Irwin Ayala

This is a website about myself.  I try to give a shot overview of past experiences and how I got here.

I've added a prompt that should execute as soon as you open the html link.  The prompt will ask for your name, this will be used for the greeting in the header portion.

After that event, a javaScript application will run asking several questions to see what you know about me.  I've decided to make it so whenever you give the right answer, it will show an alert contratulating you.  What if you get it wrong?  No need to re-test.  The alert will hint at the right answer.

Once you answer all of the prompts, you will see the complete index.  I made the header so that it stays fixed (it'll continue to show as you scroll down.)  Since it is more or less about my history, I added some old photos of me that more or less highlight what I'm talking about in the paragraphs.
