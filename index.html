    My name is Irwin Ayala.  I'm originally from Carolina, Puerto Rico.  I've been obsessed with computers since my mother bought me my first computer when I was 16 years old.  I've been tinkering and modifying my computers since the first Nvidia Geforce 256 came out many years ago.  I joined the Air Force when I was 22 years old after learning enough english to pass the ASVAB (entrance test to the military.)

    During my time in the military, I worked in the military police.  This opened many doors for me and was able to train in many different areas, but settled for counter-sniper after going through the Army Sniper School in Georgia.  I've deployed to Iraq twice with different servicees as there were very few of us at the time.  Unfortunately, my view of life changed during my service and decided to go chase money instead of messing with computers.

    After my time in service, I got my MBA and became a financial advisor with a large firm.  I absolutely loathed my job as I believe I needed to "sell my soul" in order to make it to the top.  After finance, I decided to go to the oil field and look for a niche.  A couple of years later, I was running a small business closely related to fracking.  Money was great, but I felt terrible about my impact to the world.  Also, I couldn't spend much time at home with my family.  I've missed birthdays, baseball games, soccer games, etc.  That was until March of 2020 when COVID-19 became a big deal in the US.  Oil prices plummeted and most of us had no work.  This was my oportunity to get out of my business!

    I've decided to re-design my life as I want to live it.  One of the biggest aspects for me is the type of work I want to do.  My first real love was computers (both hardware and software) and now I'm taking the steps to do the thing that I like doing.

    Some of my hobbies are working on race cars, playing videogames, installing whatever is the newest hardware out (I'm still looking for an RTX 3090), playing bass guitar, and trying to stay in shape.  It has been a struggle to keep up with my hobbies since I live in North Dakota and the weather doesn't allow me to engage in most of my favorite hobbies.  I'm planning to move to the beautiful state of Colorado later this year so that I can go back outdoors.  I'm an avid Podcast listener and one of my heroes is Neil deGrasse Tyson (even after the off-color comments).  I'm extremely curious and will do my best to learn to learn about most subjects.
